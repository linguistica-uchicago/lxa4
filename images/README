This directory contains icons for use by Linguistica:

favicon.xpm:	Linguistica logo, 32x32
open.xpm:	"Open file" icon
save.xpm:	Dark green diskette icon
new.xpm:	Blank page ("new document") icon
reload.xpm:	Light green cycle on page ("refresh document") icon
uofc.xpm:	Photograph of a building at the University of Chicago
splash.png:	Linguistica splash screen

Adding another icon is a multi-step process:

1. Add an image file (preferably .png) to this directory.

2. Add the image filename to linguistica.qrc (this can be
   done within Qt Designer by opening linguisticamainwindowbase.ui
   and choosing Edit Resources in the Resource Browser window).

3. Set the icon for the relevant action of widget to
   ":/icons/<image filename>" in linguisticamainwindowbase.ui.
   (Within Qt Designer, choose the relevant toolbar button from the
   actions list, click "..." to pick an alternate icon, specify
   that the icon will come from a resource file, then choose
   the appropriate image.)
