Linguistica - unsupervised learning of morphology
=================================================

lxa4-0
linguistica 4.0.2 This is Qt C++ code for Linguistica 4.0.2. I am posting it June 5, 2015. It currently compiles and executes under Ubuntu, but it has quite a number of warnings during compilation.

I removed several sets of functions yesterday before positing, all involving projects that had not been completed in 2010.
